The Project Manager
===================


This is the Godot project manager!
Below is where you can select any currently loaded projects.

  <style>
  img{display: inline; right: 44%; top: 39.5%;}
  </style>
  <img src="../../_static/images/project_manager/project-left.png" style="position: absolute;"></img>

**The button panel on the right is used to import, create, or manipulate a project**.
The only buttons available when opening the manager for the first time are for *loading projects*, the rest are used to manipulate a project
(*edit*, *run*, *rename*, *remove*, *remove missing*)
