==========

Godot has built in physics for 2d or 3d. For a simple demonstration we will stick with only 2D nodes.

1. **RigidBody2D**

     The most basic physics object is a `RigidBody2D <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_rigidbody2d.html>`_. A rigid body takes a collision object as a child to define the shape of the object.
